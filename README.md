NOTE: NODE.JS IS REQUIRED TO RUN THIS PROGRAM! INSTALL HERE: https://nodejs.org/en/

Deleting the file "Delete this if you know what your doing" enables Debug mode
Also you must have FFmpeg, you can install FFmpeg from https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases put it in a folder somewhere, your Desktop for example
Open CMD as Administrator, type setx /m PATH "C:\Users\<your name>\Desktop\ffmpeg\bin;%PATH%" obviously replace <your name> with your computer name and also change the other stuff if you arent installing to your desktop

All you need is Node.js and FFmpeg :) It should just work from there

HOW TO RUN:

1. Run the Install.bat file to install NPM packages
2. Run Start.bat
